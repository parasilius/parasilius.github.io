# Research

I am interested in both applied and theoretical statistics.
I have also a strong interest in computational biology and bioinformatics
and applications of statistics in psychology, economics and social sciences.

I am currently conducting research in mathematical statistics and actively seeking opportunities for academic collaboration.
