I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
During my studies, I developed a strong passion for statistics and data science,
which motivated me to pursue collaborative research in mathematical statistics.

## Research Interests

I am interested in both applied and theoretical statistics.
I have also a strong interest in computational biology and bioinformatics
and applications of statistics in psychology, economics and social sciences.
