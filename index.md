# About Me

My name is SeyedParsa Hosseinipour Rafsanjani, though I also go by Parsa H. Rafsanjani.
I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
During my studies, I developed a strong passion for statistics and data science,
which motivated me to pursue collaborative research in mathematical statistics.
